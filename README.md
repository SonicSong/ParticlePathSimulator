# ParticlePathSimulator (PPS)

ParticlePathSimulator is an open scientific project. It exists to advance public understanding of particle interactions and must remain accessible to all. Any derivative works must stay open and credit the original author

## Project Objectives

- [ ] Calculate Stopping power using Bethe-Bloch formula.
- [ ] Density/Shell correction under development
- [ ] Calculate the interactions of energetic ions with amorphous target.
- [ ] Implement GUI
- [ ] Implement Particle path graphing.
- [ ] Make it work on Windows, Linux, MacOS. X86_64 and aarch64 CPU's architecture

## Project Philosophy
PPS is not a commercial product, nor a school assignment.  
It’s an open scientific project built for curiosity, learning, and contribution to the broader understanding of how particles interact with matter.

The goal is simple: __push forward, learn everything possible, and make it open for everyone.__

This project exists because I believe knowledge should never be locked behind paywalls, NDAs, or institutions.  
SRIM and GEANT4 are great tools — but they are closed, complex, or limited. PPS aims to be an accessible, transparent alternative.

Anyone should be able to read the code, understand the formulas, and experiment freely.  
All improvements, forks, and derivative works must remain open and credit the original project.

I’m not doing this for a grade, a paycheck, or recognition.  
I’m doing this because it’s interesting — because I want to see how far a single person can go in recreating what was once considered impossible.
